##trying out new post system
its kinda clunky, but its kinda good too. I can do a post on the website and it wont go live in the app until i upload a post object in the wsr database app.

Gotta set up a new UI in the wsr DB app to help return a URL to a picture. or we can use different pictures in the posts than the headers in the app.
